# DSA CLI C#

This repository is a comprehensive C# practice project for learning and experimenting with:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Custom data structures
- Design patterns
- Delegates and threading
- Collection extensions
- Object mapping (DTOs, AutoMapper)
- SQL database and query practice

## Project Structure

### Main Application
- **Program.cs** – Entry point; contains sample invocations and code experiments.
- **CodePractice.cs** – Central hub for coding exercises, algorithms, and utility methods.
- **LeetCode.cs** – Solutions to selected LeetCode problems and algorithmic challenges.

### Data Structures & Collections
- **GenericList.cs** – Custom generic singly linked list implementation.
- **CollectionExtensions.cs** – Extension methods for collections (e.g., shuffle, random element, emptiness check).
- **ListNode.cs** – Node structure for linked lists.

### Domain Models
- **Person.cs**
- **mployee.cs**
- **Department.cs**
- **Worker.cs** – Worker class with event handling for work performed.
- **WorkType.cs**
- **ProductDto.cs**
- **PersonDto.cs**

### Data Transfer & Mapping
- **PersonProfile.cs** – AutoMapper profile for mapping between DTOs and domain models.

### Design Patterns
- **SingletonPattern.cs** – Thread-safe singleton implementation.
- **Computer.cs** – Builder pattern for constructing computer objects.

### Delegates & Functional Utilities
- **Composable.cs** – Custom delegates, function composition, and sample delegate usage.

### Threading
- **CustomThreads.cs** – Demonstrates thread creation, execution, and synchronization in C#.

### SQL Practice
- **SQLQueryPractice.sql** – SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and running queries (beginner to advanced).
- **SQLQueryPracticeDB.sql** – SQL Server database creation and configuration script.

## Features & Learning Goals

- Practice C# OOP, generics, and advanced language features
- Implement and use custom data structures
- Explore design patterns (Singleton, Builder)
- Work with delegates, events, and threading
- Extend collections with custom LINQ-style methods
- Map between domain models and DTOs using AutoMapper
- Practice SQL database design and queries

## Getting Started

1. **.NET 8.0 SDK** required (see `practice/practice.csproj`)
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code
3. Build and run the project to explore code samples and outputs
4. Review and execute SQL scripts in your preferred SQL Server environment
