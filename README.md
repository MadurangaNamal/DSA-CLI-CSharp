# DSA-CLI-CSharp

This is a C# practice project focused on object-oriented programming concepts, custom data structures, and collection manipulation. It demonstrates various techniques such as extension methods, generic collections, and object mapping.

## Project Structure

### Core Logic
- **Program.cs** – Entry point of the application.
- **CodePractice.cs** – Contains the main logic for coding exercises and sql query practice code samples
- **CollectionExtensions.cs** – Defines custom extension methods for collections.
- **Composable.cs** – Utility or helper functions, possibly for functional composition.

### Custom Data Structures
- **GenericList.cs** – A custom implementation of a generic list.
- **ListNode.cs** – Defines the node structure used in the generic list.

### Domain Models
- **Person.cs**, **Employee.cs**, **Worker.cs**, **Worktype.cs** – Class definitions modeling different types of people and their roles.

### Data Transfer & Mapping
- **PersonDto.cs** – Data Transfer Object for the `Person` class.
- **PersonProfile.cs** – Likely used for mapping between `Person` and `PersonDto` using a library like AutoMapper.

## Purpose

This project serves as a playground to:
- Practice C# fundamentals.
- Understand generic data structures.
- Implement clean coding patterns.
- Experiment with object mapping and DTOs.
- Practice sql queries from beginner level -> advanced queries
